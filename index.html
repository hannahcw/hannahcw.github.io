         <p>I was born in South Carolina and then moved to Italy, Georgia, and Kentucky, respectively.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy travel, skiing, writing, trying new things, and I work on cars as a way to destress from school and do something with my hands. I am engaged to my best friend and we will be getting married this summer. I am Independant Baptist and am a member of Bluegrass Baptist Chruch in Georgetown, KY.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I am not sure what I would like to do for my career yet but I would like to continue learning languages and persuing an education, I am a communication major and a Spanish minor and plan to switch into PR, marketing, or a more specific field of Communication.
